Step-1> Make a local repository on your system
	>mkdir test1
	>cd test1

Step-2> We need a remote cloud repo of any verson control system(github,svn)
	Angular7

Step-3> Local repo we need to initiate as a git repo by using 
	>git init

Step-4> We need to configure our git repo by giving verson control system credentials
	>git config user.name "faiz11amd"
	>git config user.email "faiz11amd@gmail.com"

Step-5> Now we need to connect our local repo to remote repo by using - "origin" is just a name u can use another also.
	>git remote add origin "https://github.com/faiz11amd/Angular7"
-- If we want to remove remote url
	>git remote remove/rm <remoteName>
-- list all remote url
	>git remote -v

Step-6> Now we add our file to staging area(ready to commit)
	>git add file_name.extention (add file to staging area)

Step-7> Commit your changes with some message in local repo
	>git commit -m "message"

Step-8> If fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories or local and remote file are not matched
	>git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories

Step-9> we can push our files from local repo to remote repo
	>git push origin branch_name or >git push -f origin branch_name (-f for force push)

	>enter your username:faiz11amd
	>enter your password:F@iz11061992
	

>git branch (list all the branch of repo)
>git branch branch_name (create new branch)
>git checkout branch_name (switch current branch to mention branch_name)

>git log (show log of your all works)
>git status (shows which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git)
>git stash (temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on)

> git rm -r file_name (deleted from local)
> git commit -m "message"
> git push origin master (changes refelected in remote)
